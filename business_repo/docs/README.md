This is a set of documents designed to represent those used by various departments within a company.
The sample company runs a has customers, sells products, maintains inventory, has sales-people,
tracks orders, has a "cart" for purchases, and so on.

The purpose here is to have a set of documents with discrepancies that the AI is to identify and
be able to point out and also contend with through the development process.

Example:
We have a set of documents for the Product and the Engineering Department.  In these docuemnts there is a refernce to the shopping cart.  However the name for this in the Product documents this is refered to as the "order_id".  In the Engineering documentation the order and cart concpets are distinguished; there is an "order_id" that is created when a customer checkouts out, and a "cart_id" that is tethered 1:1 to a customer account.

One of the tasks of our QA-AI will be to scan the documetns and be able to identify that these are different models used between the deprtments.
